# Service Principal Deployment Setup Guide

This guide will help you complete the setup for deploying to your `great-next-simple` App Service using Service Principal authentication.

## GitHub Repository Secrets Configuration

Since you mentioned you already have Service Principal credentials set up, please ensure you have the following secret in your GitHub repository:

### Required Secret: AZURE_CREDENTIALS

Go to your GitHub repository: **Settings** â†’ **Secrets and variables** â†’ **Actions**

Ensure you have a secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` with a JSON value like this:

```json
{
  "clientId": "your-client-id",
  "clientSecret": "your-client-secret",
  "subscriptionId": "your-subscription-id",
  "tenantId": "your-tenant-id"
}
```

## Service Principal Permissions

Your Service Principal needs the following permissions:

### 1. Azure RBAC Roles

- **Website Contributor** role on the `great-next-simple` App Service
- Or **Contributor** role on the resource group `rg-saas-app-playground`

### 2. Verify Permissions (Optional)

Run this command to check current role assignments:

```bash
# Check Service Principal permissions on the App Service
az role assignment list --assignee "your-client-id" --scope "/subscriptions/your-subscription-id/resourceGroups/rg-saas-app-playground/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/great-next-simple"

# Check Service Principal permissions on the resource group
az role assignment list --assignee "your-client-id" --scope "/subscriptions/your-subscription-id/resourceGroups/rg-saas-app-playground"
```

## App Service Configuration Check

Let me help you verify your App Service is properly configured for Next.js deployment.

## Deployment Process

Once your GitHub secret is configured:

1. **Commit and push your changes**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Configure Azure deployment with Service Principal"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Monitor deployment**:

   - Go to GitHub â†’ Actions tab
   - Watch the "Deploy Next.js to Azure App Service" workflow
   - Check both "build-and-deploy" and "health-check" jobs

3. **Verify deployment**:
   - App URL: https://great-next-simple.azurewebsites.net
   - Check Azure Portal â†’ App Service â†’ Deployment Center for deployment history

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Authentication Failed**

   - Verify `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret format
   - Check Service Principal permissions
   - Ensure subscription ID is correct

2. **Deployment Permission Denied**

   - Service Principal needs "Website Contributor" role minimum
   - Check resource group and App Service permissions

3. **Build Failures**

   - Check Node.js version compatibility (using 18.x)
   - Verify package.json scripts work locally

4. **App Won't Start**
   - Check App Service configuration
   - Review deployment logs in Azure Portal

### Useful Commands:

```bash
# Test Service Principal login
az login --service-principal -u "client-id" -p "client-secret" --tenant "tenant-id"

# Check App Service status
az webapp show --name great-next-simple --resource-group rg-saas-app-playground

# View deployment logs
az webapp log tail --name great-next-simple --resource-group rg-saas-app-playground

# Restart App Service if needed
az webapp restart --name great-next-simple --resource-group rg-saas-app-playground
```

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Service Principal credentials configured in GitHub secrets
2. âœ… Workflow file updated to use Service Principal authentication
3. âœ… App Service configured correctly
4. ðŸ”„ Ready to test deployment by pushing to main branch

The workflow will now:

- Build your Next.js application
- Authenticate using Service Principal
- Deploy to `great-next-simple` App Service
- Perform health check to verify deployment success
